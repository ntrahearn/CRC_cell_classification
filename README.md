# CRC Cell Classification Pipeline

This repository contains the code for the whole slide image cell classification pipeline used in the paper *Computational pathology applied to clinical colorectal cancer cohorts identifies immune and endothelial cell spatial patterns predictive of outcome* by Trahearn, *et al*.

Included are scripts for both cell detection and classification on a whole slide image, as well as scripts for training the models.
